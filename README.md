# RFSM

RFSM could be better classified as a hack and slash action RPG.

In RFSM (Rescue From Sugarcoat Mountain) SugaChibis from all around the world have been kidnapped by a vengeful stork who believes to be the ultimate mother. By incarnating a SugaChibi with thirst for freedom, the player will travel a world of awe and sweetness, while trying to free his fellow SugaChibis from imprisonment in a fantasy world taken straight out of Willy Wonkaâ€™s mind.
